You’re all set to start!

## Marketing Application

1. Start the marketing application

```bash
pnpm --filter marketing dev
```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001

You’re all set to start!

## Troubleshoot

### The generated Prisma types are not loaded.

Restart VS code (or the TS server).

### It seems that I can't login

The database is probably not set up.

### NPM throws an error

In the monorepo version npm is no longer supported. It's all pnpm now. The problem is that npm, yarn and pnpm have different workspace syntax and package hoisting patterns. Supporting all package managers is not possible in a monorepo setup and pnpm is the most popular one.
